- after everything you have implemented, update PLAN.md with the updates and possible todos.
- always use 'uv add' to manage dependencies (do not forget to run 'uv sync' afterwards). avoid direct calls to pip.
- use 'uv run' to run any python code.
- never run "python" directly, instead use "uv run python"
- use ruff for linting and formatting.
