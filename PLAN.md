# Asynchronous Scolar Plan

## Architecture Overview

- [x] Orchestrate tasks with `asyncio`; main entry creates a queue of URLs, awaits per-page tasks, aggregates reports.
- [x] Use a shared `httpx.AsyncClient` with connection pooling and an `asyncio.Semaphore` to cap concurrency.
- [x] Offload synchronous HTML parsing and markdown conversion via `asyncio.to_thread` to avoid blocking the event loop.
- [x] Execute OpenAI requests with the async client, keeping them sequential by default and guarding with a semaphore if future parallelism is desired.
- [x] Persist markdown artifacts using `asyncio.to_thread`; reporting can remain synchronous once data is collected.

## Key Components

- [x] `config.py`: Dynaconf-backed configuration validated with Pydantic, exposing concurrency limits, timeouts, model settings, and output paths.
- [x] `models.py`: Dataclasses (`PageContent`, `PageAssessment`, `LinkInfo`) and helpers for JSON validation.
- [x] `fetcher.py`: `async fetch(url, session)` with retries, content-type checks, and size guardrails.
- [x] `parser.py`: Synchronous HTMLâ†’markdown + link extraction invoked through `to_thread`.
- [x] `storage.py`: Async helpers to write markdown files and return artifact paths.
- [x] `summarizer.py` (LLM assessment helpers): Async wrapper around the OpenAI client enforcing JSON schema checks.
- [x] `report.py`: Markdown and JSON rendering helpers for processed pages.
- [x] `main.py`: CLI handling for markdown output, optional JSON export, and wiring of async pipeline components.

## Data Flow

1. [x] `main` seeds URL jobs.
2. [x] `fetcher.fetch` concurrently retrieves HTML and records failures.
3. [x] `parser.parse_html` returns `PageContent` with markdown and outbound links.
4. [x] `storage.store_markdown` persists markdown artifacts and tracks truncation.
5. [x] `summarizer.assess_page` invokes the LLM for summaries and ratings.
6. [x] `report` emits markdown and JSON structures for downstream consumption.

## Dependencies & Settings

- [x] Libraries: `httpx[http2]`, `beautifulsoup4`, `html2text`, `openai`, `pydantic`, `dynaconf`, test deps `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio` (optional `tenacity` for retries).
- [x] Configuration: Dynaconf `settings.toml` + environment overrides validated through Pydantic and CLI flags for concurrency, model name, truncation limits, and output directory.
- [x] Logging: `logging.basicConfig` currently used; structured logging via `dictConfig` remains future work.

## Testing

- [x] Configuration module coverage via pytest (`tests/test_config.py`) ensuring type safety, precedence, and path handling.
- [x] Async pipeline integration tests with mocked HTTP and LLM clients (`tests/test_integration.py`).
- [x] Report serialization unit test (`tests/test_report.py`).
- [x] CLI-level test verifying markdown and JSON outputs with mocked dependencies (`tests/test_cli.py`).
- [x] End-to-end smoke equivalent via CLI run_async entry, covering the same code path as `uv run scolar`.

## Recent Updates

- [x] Eliminated `typing.Any` usages in configuration and integration tests to tighten static type coverage.
- [x] Migrated legacy generics (`Dict`, `List`, `Optional`) to builtin `dict`, `list`, and union syntax across runtime and tests.
- [x] Added GitHub Actions workflow that syncs dependencies with `uv` and runs `ruff check` plus `mypy` on pushes and pull requests.
- [x] Extended CI workflow to execute `uv run pytest` alongside lint and type checks.
- [x] Verified `_build_slug` hash suffix logic and ensured duplicate-title collision coverage via `tests/test_storage.py` on October 3, 2025.

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Add optional structured logging configuration if deeper observability is required.
2. [ ] Consider snapshot-based assertions for large markdown outputs once additional report sections are introduced.
3. [x] Evaluate adding a static type checker (e.g., mypy or pyright) to enforce stricter annotations in CI (confirmed mypy already runs via CI workflow and pre-commit).
4. [x] Audit remaining modules for `collections.abc` usage to ensure consistency with modern type hints (confirmed only `main.py` and integration tests import `Iterable` from `collections.abc`).

## New Features

- [ ] add a search query generator that will given the prompt create various search queries that help discover links to answer the question.
- [ ] add a link relevancy scoring function that will evaluate a link for relevancy to the initial prompt and to the generated search queries. (for example making sure that when we search about Tool v5.x we don't include links to Tool v4.x, or similar named tools from other areas of technology etc.)
